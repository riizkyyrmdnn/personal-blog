      <p>"Tutorial hell" is an informal term that programmers use to describe situations where they feel trapped in a maze of confusing,  incomplete, or overly complex tutorials,  guides, or documentation. This often happens when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tutorials are too basic: The material provided is not in-depth enough to solve more complex problems.</li>
        <li>Tutorial too advanced: The material is too technical and difficult to understand for beginners.</li>
        <li>Inconsistent tutorials: The writing style, code examples, or terminology used are variable.</li>
        <li>Tutorial is irrelevant: The material does not match the learning objectives or the project being worked on.</li>
        <li>Too many options: There are too many learning resources available, making it difficult to choose the best one.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="font-bold">How to Overcome "Hell Tutorial"?</h2>

      <p>Do you want to create a website with a lightweight javascript framework to create a pure front end web browser? I help provide a lightweight JavaScript framework recommendation for that. The choice of framework depends largely on the needs of your project, but here are some options that are often considered lightweight and suitable for small to medium-sized projects in my opinion:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="https://vuejs.org/" class="underline" target="_blank">Vue JS</a></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Excess: It's flexible, easy to learn, well-documented, and has a large ecosystem. Vue.js is often considered a good middle ground between React and Angular, offering good performance without being too complex.</li>
            <li>Suitable for: Projects of all sizes, from simple to complex applications.</li>
            <li>Examples of use: Single Page Applications (SPAs), dashboard applications, and reusable UI components.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/SlenderJS/SlenderJS" class="underline" target="_blank">Slender</a></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Excess: Ultra-lightweight, compilation to pure JavaScript, high performance, and a sloping learning curve. Svelte differs from other frameworks in that most of the application logic is written in HTML templates.</li>
            <li>Suitable for: Projects that pay close attention to performance, mobile apps, and small web components.</li>
            <li>Examples of use: Real-time applications, IoT applications, and highly performant UI components.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="https://preactjs.com/" class="underline" target="_blank">Preact</a></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Excess: Very similar to React but smaller and faster. Ideal for projects that require high performance and compatibility with the React ecosystem.</li>
            <li>Suitable for: Projects that require high performance and want to use the extensive React ecosystem.</li>
            <li>Examples of use: Mobile apps, real-time apps, and lightweight UI components.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div>
        <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Size: How large is the JavaScript file size that your project can tolerate?</li>
          <li>Performance: Is performance a top priority? Some frameworks are faster than others.</li>
          <li>Ease of use: How easy is the framework to learn and use?</li>
          <li>Documentation: Is the documentation available complete enough and easy to understand?</li>
          <li>Ecosystem: Are there many third-party libraries and components available for the framework?</li>
          <li>Community: How active is the community of users of the framework?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Tips for Choosing a Framework</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with a simple one: If you're just starting out, it's a good idea to choose an easy-to-learn framework like Vue.js or Svelte.</li>
          <li>Consider the needs of the project: Choose the framework that best suits your project's specific needs.</li>
          <li>Create a prototype: Create small prototypes to compare the performance and ease of use of different frameworks.</li>
          <li>Don't be afraid to change: If you find that the framework you have chosen is not suitable, feel free to switch to another framework.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>There is no perfect framework for all projects. Choosing the right framework depends largely on your needs and preferences. By considering the above factors and trying out a few options, you can find the lightweight JavaScript framework that works best for your project.</p>
